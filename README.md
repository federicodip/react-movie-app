# 🎬 React Movie App

A simple movie browsing app built with **React + Vite**.  
Search for movies, view details, and manage a list of favorites — all with a clean, responsive UI.

> Forked and extended from a tutorial project. I added a **Movie Details** page, improved styles, and deployment scripts.
